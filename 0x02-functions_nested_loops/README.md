0. Write a program that prints _putchar followed by a new line. The program should return 0.
1. Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase followed by a new line. Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);. You can only use _putchar twice in your code.
2. Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. void print_alphabet_x10(void);. You can only use _putchar twice in your code.
3. Write a function that checks for lowercase character. Prototype: int _islower(int c);. Return 1 if c is lowercase. Returns 0 otherwise.
4. Write a function that checks if a character is an alphabet character whether lowercase or uppercase.
5. Write a function that prints the sign of a number.
6. Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer. Prototype: int _abs(int);.
